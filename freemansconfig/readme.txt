*** Installation **************************************************************
1.1. Install config:
    - Unpack to
      '..\Steam\steamapps\*accountname*\common\team fortress 2\tf\custom'

    - In case of new installation:
        + In '..\custom\freemansconfig\cfg\', rename '_settings_backup.cfg' to
          '_settings.cfg' and edit your settings in this file
        + Start TF2 and open keyboard settings
        + Press 'Use defaults', then edit the bindings to your likings

1.2. Uninstall config
    - Delete ..\custom\freemansconfig\
    - Start Tf2 and open keyboard settings
    - Press 'Use defaults', then edit the bindings to your likings


*** Generell scripts **********************************************************
2.1. Weaponslot dependent settings
    Set up weaponslot dependet settings in '_settings.cfg'. More specialised
    weaponslots will overwrite less specialised ones; e.g. 'slot1_cls' will 
    overwrite the settings in 'slots_all', 'slot1_scout' will overwrite
    settings in 'slot1_cls' etc.

2.2. Custom quickswitch behaviour
    Quickswitch (default Q) can switch between specific weaponslots instead of
    just switching to the last used weapon. These settings can be changed
    on-the-fly ingame with a pop-up-menu (default SHIFT). Default quickswitch
    behaviour is specified in '_settings.cfg'.

2.3. Movement script
    Normally, moving forwards/left prevents the player from moving
    backwards/right. The movement script allows doing that.

2.4. Killing Floor-like voicemenu
    If you know Killing Floor, you love its voicemenu. Added a voicemenu that
    more or less Ã­s the same.
    To enable, bind it to a key in the keyboard settings.
    Once you've opened the voicemenu ingame, you can close it/go one menu back
    by hitting the voicemenu-key again.

2.5. Spawnswap scripts
    Quickly switch to another class, then switch back to your old class by
    hitting the spawnswap-key again. Only works if you don't spam it too
    quickly (before you actually joined as another class). If you spam it too
    quickly, it breaks and you will not spawn as your desired class. You then
    manually have to switch to your class again (or reload config, there's a
    keybind option for it in the keyboard-settings).

2.6. Ingame menu
    Change your quickswitch behaviour and enable some class specific scripts
    on the fly.


*** Class specific scripts ****************************************************
3.1. Soldier
    - Rocketjump-script: Performs Crouchjump-attack with one buttonpress, won't
        give you the best rocketjumps, but does the trick if you're lazy

3.2. Pyro
    - Panicbutton: Spin around like crazy while screaming in agony and burning
        them all.

3.3. Demoman
    - Different behaviour depending on which weapon you choose as your
      secondary (you have to choose your loadout in the ingame-menu, the script
      cannot detect which weapon you actually have equipped. Choose the default
      setting in '_settings.cfg'):
        Stickies: usual behaviour
        Shields:  Always quickswitch between melee and primary; switch to melee
                  and charge when alt-attacking.

3.4. Medic
    - alt-attack always switches to medicgun and charges if your ubercharge is
      ready.

3.5. Engineer
    - Buildscript:
        Classkey + 1x 1-4: build a sentry/dispenser/tele-entrance/tele-exit
        Classkey + 2x 1-4: destroy respective building
